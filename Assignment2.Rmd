## Created by Thomas Walsh

  Hi, and welcome to my second *assignment*, I am very excited to continue my coding journey.
  
  Here is a table regarding the **best** and worst Mario Kart characters:
  
  Mario Kart Character | Usage | Opinion
  ---------------------|-------|----------
       Toad            | Lots  | Overrated 
       Yoshi           | Yuh   | Beast
       Peach           | Eh    | Underrated
     Baby Mario        | Decent| HATE
     
![](Yoshi.jfif)  
`Look at this beast`

Here is a unordered list of Mario Kart characters

* Toad 
* Yoshi
* Mario
  + Baby Mario
* Peach

Here is an ordered list of Mario Kart characters

1. Yoshi
2. Peach
3. Toad
4. Baby Mario (boo)

Here is an equation for the size of Baby Mario's head:
$V = 4/3 * \pi*r^2$ 

The date today is the 10^th^ not the 10~th~
